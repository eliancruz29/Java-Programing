# Java-Programing
Instruction to prepare the project for being able to be used:

1. Download the starter code zip file from the following link. Save it wherever you like.

2. Extract the zip file somewhere outside of your Eclipse workspace folder.

3. Open Eclipse if it is not already open.

4. From the File menu in Eclipse select “Import...”

5. In the Import window, expand General and select “Existing Projects into Workspace”. Then click “Next >”

6. In the window that appears, click “Browse” next to "Select root directory” (keep this option selected).

7. In the File Chooser, browse to where you uncompressed the starter code. It should be in a folder named “UCSDUnfoldingMaps”. Select this folder (NOT one of the subfolders) and click “OK”.

8. You should see the UCSDUnfoldingMaps project selected under Projects. Make sure the option to "Copy projects into workspace" is checked, then click “Finish”.

9. Now, you should see the project in your Eclipse workspace. In the Package Explorer you will see the UCSDUnfoldingMaps project. If you expand this project you will see several folders including src, data and some library folders. src is where all of your source (Java) code that we provide is located. This is also where all the code you will write will be placed. If you expand src you will see module6. the main class is "EarthquakeCityMap". you just have to run like applet application.
